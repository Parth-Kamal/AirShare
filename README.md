# AirShare
AirShare is an AI-powered file transfer application that allows users to send files using hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical input devices. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, AirShare accurately recognizes predefined hand movements to trigger file selection and wireless transfer over a local network via HTTP/WebSockets.
